## v1.4.23 - Audio Decode Memory Guard

- Added audio decode diagnostics in `FoxBearAudioDecodeService.getDiagnostics()`.
- Tracks active/completed/failed decodes, recent decode events, last decoded PCM size, and last error.
- `decodeAudioFile()` now explicitly releases its temporary `ArrayBuffer` reference in `finally` after Web Audio decoding.
- Performance diagnostics now include `audioDecode` and warn on `audio-decode-active` / `audio-decode-last-error`.
- Runtime Health now requires `FoxBearAudioDecodeService.getDiagnostics`.
- v1.4.22 mastering queue throttle, v1.4.21 render scheduler, and 35-track sequential import guard remain carried forward.
- Dock FFT removal carry-forward: Dock mini FFT remains removed and detail-only spectrum stays available.

## v1.4.23 - Mastering Queue Throttle / Diagnostics

- Added `FoxBearMasteringGuard.getSnapshot()` for active mastering diagnostics.
- `setMasteringProgress()` now uses `scheduleRenderAll('mastering-progress', ...)` so every 5% progress step does not force an immediate full render.
- Mastering final UI refresh still flushes immediately through `scheduleRenderAll('mastering-final', { immediate: true })`.
- Added explicit transient buffer cleanup in the mastering `finally` path.
- Performance diagnostics now include `masteringQueue` and a `mastering-active` warning.
- Added `qa/v1422_mastering_queue_throttle_smoke.js` and `qa/BROWSER_BACK_QA_MATRIX_1.4.23.md`.
- v1.4.21 render scheduler, silent wake-lock import, stable analysis cache key, and audio decode service carry forward.


- v1.4.21 Performance diagnostics remain available while bulk import guard reports queued import state.
# v1.4.21 stability - Bulk Import Guard / 35-Track PC Crash Hotfix

- Fixed a PC bulk import crash path reported when selecting 35 songs at once.
- Track registration now batches UI rendering and queues decoding/analysis instead of starting every file immediately.
- Added a single-lane import analysis queue (`FoxBearBulkImportGuard`) to avoid simultaneous `file.arrayBuffer()` + `AudioContext.decodeAudioData()` storms.
- Added large-batch status messaging so 12+ selected songs show safe queue progress.
- Added `qa/v1421_bulk_import_guard_smoke.js` and `qa/BROWSER_BACK_QA_MATRIX_1.4.21.md`.

# Changelog

## v1.4.21 - Download dialog first-screen declutter
- Added `FoxBearDownloadService.getDownloadDialogDisplayProfile()` so the dialog can separate initial/open-state copy from post-action guidance.
- Main download popup now uses `download-options-panel-v5` and `data-download-display-mode` for `restricted-declutter` / `standard-declutter` modes.
- Initial receipt renders in idle mode and hides the full checklist until the user presses download/share/assist/diagnostics/copy.

- Dock FFT removal and settings gear alignment remain active.
- Performance diagnostics and adaptive refresh remain available.
- Packaging polish remains active: overwrite ZIP naming follows `package.json`.

## v1.4.21 - Render Scheduler + Bulk Import UI Throttle

- Added `FoxBearRenderScheduler` to merge repeated `renderAll()` calls into scheduled frame updates during analysis/import.
- Bulk import analysis remains sequential, and large-batch UI refreshes are throttled so 35-track imports are less likely to stutter or crash.
- Automatic Wake Lock activation during analysis/playback is now silent; manual settings toggles still show user feedback.
- Single-file imports keep the AI recommendation choice dialog, while multi-file and large-batch imports auto-apply each track's AI recommendation without one popup per file.
- Playback transitions use a smoother 140ms fade and wait for the next audio element to be media-ready before fading out the old source.
- Analysis cache keys now use `ANALYSIS_ENGINE_CACHE_VERSION` instead of `APP_VERSION`, reducing unnecessary re-analysis across patch releases.
- Added `FoxBearAudioDecodeService` as the first decode-path split from `src/app.js`.

Dock FFT removal carry-forward: v1.4.21 preserves Dock FFT removal while focusing on render scheduling and import stability.
